I was assigned the loading page, error page and success page
I designed the wireframes for the 3 screens making use of simple shapes
I design the low fidelity screens making use of picture frames components and texts.
I designed the high fidelity designs
which I accomplished by downloading images from unsplash
removed the background using remove BG plugin
I made use of the image in my designs on the team's project board 
in collaboration with the style guides and components we already created.
